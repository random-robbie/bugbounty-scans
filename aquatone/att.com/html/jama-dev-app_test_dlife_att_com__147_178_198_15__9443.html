<h1>It works !</h1>

<p>If you're seeing this page via a web browser, it means you've setup Tomcat successfully. Congratulations!</p>
 
<p>This is the default Tomcat home page. It can be found on the local filesystem at: <code>/var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/ROOT/index.html</code></p>

<p>Tomcat8 veterans might be pleased to learn that this system instance of Tomcat is installed with <code>CATALINA_HOME</code> in <code>/usr/share/tomcat8</code> and <code>CATALINA_BASE</code> in <code>/var/lib/tomcat8</code>, following the rules from <code>/usr/share/doc/tomcat8-common/RUNNING.txt.gz</code>.</p>

<p>You might consider installing the following packages, if you haven't already done so:</p>

<p><b>tomcat8-docs</b>: This package installs a web application that allows to browse the Tomcat 8 documentation locally. Once installed, you can access it by clicking <a href="docs/">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>tomcat8-examples</b>: This package installs a web application that allows to access the Tomcat 8 Servlet and JSP examples. Once installed, you can access it by clicking <a href="examples/">here</a>.</p>
